### Overview of the analysis
Analysis:
- The purpose of this analysis was to be able to utilize the data I was given by its city type. The following types of cities were Rural, Urban, and Suburban using these different types we had to analyze this data into different categories and find different prices each city costed to ride in. By using Jupyter Notebook I utilized pandas dataframe and groupby() function to group data into categories I needed. Afterwards this needed me to use indexing to pull the data for each category. After creating a DataFrame for each city type I needed to make a graph showing the Fare price in USD and seperated by months.

Results:
- Looking at the DataFrames we can see that Rural cities have the least amount of rides but the most expensive prices.
- Looking at Suburban cities we can see that they have the second most rides and second most expensive fares.
- Lastly we can see Urban cities with the most amount of rides but they have the cheapest fares but had the largets fare amount.

### Graph Gained From Data

Summary:
- The data we got from this was that the fre will be based on which city type that the individual is riding in. However, with many gaps in the data such as lack on information of week to week based fares I would be unable to calculate the city's income range and decide how much you would need to make to live comfortably using these services.
